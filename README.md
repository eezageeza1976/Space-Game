# Space-Game
A basic space game avoiding blocks using a space ship

A basic space ship game avoiding blocks and collecting stars.

The space ship is controlled with the mouse and thrust is created using the left mouse button.

Very basic Menu with new game and Quit functions. When mouse cursor is over the menu options the option box has alpha to show it is hovered over.

First go at using sprites and basic explosion graphics.

Still loads to do:
Proper menu
Quitting properly from the game back to menu
Work out a better way of coding the menu run event
Making other levels
WHat to do when all the stars have been collected (Currently the level just continues without finishing after all stars collected)
